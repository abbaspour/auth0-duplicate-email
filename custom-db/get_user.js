  // This script should retrieve a user profile from your existing database,
  // without authenticating the user.
  // It is used to check if a user exists before executing flows that do not
  // require authentication (signup and password reset).
  //
  // There are three ways this script can finish:
  // 1. A user was successfully found. The profile should be in the following
  // format: https://auth0.com/docs/user-profile/normalized.
  //     callback(null, profile);
  // 2. A user was not found
  //     callback(null);
  // 3. Something went wrong while trying to reach your database:
  //     callback(new Error("my error message"));
